<h2>General information</h2>
Rock Paper Lizard Scciors Spock, the game made famous by the Big Bang theory sitcom TV show. 
For my project, I wanted to build this version of the classic game; Rock, Paper, Scissors due to the winning and loosing conditions, which are a bit more complex than the classic version. 
I wanted to take on this challenge as being new to Javascript, I wanted to push myself more than what was covered in the current course.

The game is very simple, select an icon and the bot or PC will then choose it's own icon at random - which in turn will then decide the winner! <br> <br>
There is a maximum of 10 points to win, either the player (You) or the bot will win. If either win, the game will prompt a message stating who has won and will refresh with a new game.

<h2>Design</h2>
The design of my project is very simple. I decisioned that for bigger monitors such as desktop / laptop that the icons for the game are to be spread across the screen to make it visually more appealing. While for mobile and tablet devices it is the opposite - the icons will be displayed vertically. 

I created a very simple wiregrapic for both veritcle and horozontal views.
